| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| LO (Level 0)                      | No AI + Tools (Perception + Actions)                         |
| L1 (Level 1)                      | Rule-based AI + Tools (Perception + Actions)                 |
| L2 (Level 2)                      | IL/RL-based AI + Tools (Perception + Actions) + Reasoning & Decision Making |
| L3 (Level 3)                      | LLM-based AI + Tools (Perception + Actions) + Reasoning & Decision Making + Memory & Reflection |
| L4 (Level 4)                      | LLM-based AI + Tools (Perception) + Actions + Reasoning & Decision Making + Memory & Reflection + Autonomous Learning + Generalization |
| L5 (Level 5)                      | LLM-based AI + Tools (Perception) + Actions + Reasoning & Decision Making + Memory + Reflection + Autonomous Learning + Generalization + Personality (Emotion + Character) + Collaborative behavior (Multi-Agents) |
