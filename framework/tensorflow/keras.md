# Keras

Keras is TensorFlow’s high-level deep learning API: it allows you to build, train, evaluate, and execute all sorts of neural networks. The original Keras library was developed by François Chollet as part of a research project⁠ and was released as a standalone open source project in March 2015. It quickly gained popularity, owing to its ease of use, flexibility, and beautiful design

Keras used to support multiple backends, including TensorFlow, PlaidML, Theano, and Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (the last two are sadly deprecated), but since version 2.4, Keras is TensorFlow-only. Similarly, TensorFlow used to include multiple high-level APIs, but Keras was officially chosen as its preferred high-level API when TensorFlow 2 came out. Installing TensorFlow will automatically install Keras as well, and Keras will not work without TensorFlow installed. In short, Keras and TensorFlow fell in love and got married.
